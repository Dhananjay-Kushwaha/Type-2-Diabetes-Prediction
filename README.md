# Type-2-Diabetes-Prediction
The Type 2 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning with SVM ( Support Vector Machine ) project is a pioneering initiative that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to forecast the likelihood of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) development by analyzing extensive historical health data from a diverse population.

» The symptoms are the key factors to predict any disease.
» Standard dataset has been used for this work with 75:25 ratio for training and testing.
» The results were compared between the existing methods and proposed method to show the proposed method has high accuracy.
» To predict the diabetes in our proposed system we have use dataset as input.
» Dataset consists of several features they are Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age.
